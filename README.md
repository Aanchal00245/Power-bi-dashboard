📊 Project Title: Credit Risk Modeling and Dashboard Creation

🔍 Objective:
Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze and predict credit risks using historical loan and borrower data. This project focuses on identifying key risk indicators, segmenting borrower profiles, and providing actionable insights for financial institutions.

💡 Key Highlights:

Loan Status Analysis: Visualized loan categories (approved, denied, defaulted) using bar charts, pie charts, and slicers to identify trends and patterns.
Borrower Segmentation: Categorized borrowers based on demographics and financial metrics to identify high-risk groups.
Predictive Insights: Incorporated predictive algorithms and scenario analyses to forecast loan defaults and simulate economic impacts.
Time Series Trends: Analyzed seasonal and long-term credit risk patterns using line charts.
Correlation Analysis: Examined relationships between variables like income, credit scores, and default rates to identify key predictors.
Security Features: Ensured data privacy and regulatory compliance through robust security measures and monitoring.
🎯 Impact:
This dashboard enables financial institutions to make data-driven decisions by providing clear visibility into loan performance, borrower behavior, and predictive risk analysis. It helps optimize lending policies, improve portfolio health, and ensure compliance with industry standards.

🔗 Tools & Technologies Used:

Power BI for data visualization and dashboard creation.
Predictive modeling for forecasting default probabilities.
Data analysis techniques for segmentation, correlation, and trend analysis.
